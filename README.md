Homework 13.2: Model for "Guess the secret number" results

Design your "Guess the secret number" game in a way that every result will be
stored as an object.
Create a model called Result, that takes the following data:
● score
● player_name
● date
Then save the objects into a results.json file (use the __dict__ method, like in
the previous homework).
